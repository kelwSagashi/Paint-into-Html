# Paint-into-Html

This project uses JavaScript, where I build a canvas for drawing with html and css elements to style the frames on the canvas. The drawings are made through elements created within the script and edited with "style.background" to change the colors of the "pixels".  Note: The image generated through the drawing is merely for visualization, because for a process to save the image it would have to be 1 pixel in height and width, which still does not happen within the code, because the pixel size varies according to the the size chosen for the image. Example: 1 pixel, on a 16x16 screen, is actually 6.75px in height and width. See that to generate the image faithfully to an original image, of a size consistent with the specified, the script would need some modifications that in the future can be implemented.  We have some tools in here like changing the color you want to paint, image size and brush size, we still need more like, eraser and other critical elements.  Note: the eraser will work like the one in Paint, it will be white and paint with white color, it will not necessarily erase.
